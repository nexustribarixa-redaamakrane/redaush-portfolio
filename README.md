# Redaush Portfolio

Hi! I’m **Reda Amakrane** (nicknames: Redaush, Nexus Tribarixa), a student and aspiring tech leader from Berkane, Morocco. I study at Al-Qods Middle School (1st grade of middle school) and also at High Up Academy.

## About Me

I’m passionate about IT, cartoons, and creating innovative technology that can make a difference. I kindly ask for your support to help me achieve my dream — I don’t chase clout or trends, but truth and meaningful impact.

## My Ambitions & Dreams

I’m building **nVortex**, a multipurpose tech company focused on AI, broadcasting, software development, and digital media. My goal is to empower communities and bring creative solutions to life.

**Disclaimer:** I am currently building nVortex and do not claim it to be an existing company yet. This is my vision and work in progress. I’m eager to collaborate with experienced developers to make this company a reality and help it grow, Insha’Allah.

I’m only 12 years old, but I’m determined to build nVortex and become its CEO and founder by age 13 or 12. I want to base the company in Berkane, a city that really needs more meaningful companies and development. This is my dream for my hometown, for my country and for my future.
