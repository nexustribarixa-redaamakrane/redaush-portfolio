## 💡 About Me
I’m passionate about IT, cartoons, and creating innovative technology that makes a real difference. I focus on **truth and meaningful impact**, not trends or clout.

## 🌟 My Ambitions & Dreams
I’m building **nVortex**, a multipurpose tech company focused on:  

- 🤖 AI and smart solutions  
- 📺 Broadcasting & digital media  
- 💻 Software development  

My goal is to empower communities and bring creative solutions to life.

**Disclaimer:** nVortex is currently a work in progress. I’m eager to collaborate with experienced developers to make it a reality, Insha’Allah.

At 12 years old, I’m determined to become the CEO and founder of nVortex by 13. I want to bring development and innovation to Berkane, my hometown, and create a meaningful impact for my country and the world.

## 🤝 Collaborators & Mentorship Welcome
I’m still learning and growing, and I’d love to connect with experienced developers, designers, and mentors who can guide me on this journey. If you’re passionate about innovation, tech, or just want to support a young dreamer from Berkane, please reach out!

For now, I’m using **Noto Sans** for all my UI designs, but I’m actively working on developing my own custom font to use once **nVortex HQ** is founded. I’ll design how each website page should look, and I’m looking for collaborators who can carefully replicate those designs exactly as I envision them. Your attention to detail, creativity, and teamwork will help bring these ideas to life.

Together, we can build something amazing. Your advice, collaboration, or even just encouragement would mean a lot.  
Let’s create the future — Insha’Allah!
